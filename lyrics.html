            <h4>Drake remains too big to fail.</h4>

            <p>
                In honor of hip-hop's 50th anniversary year, we're looking back at the top
                artists, songs, albums, and producers of “The Genius Era,” 2009 to the present.
            </p>
            <p>
                Theoretically, things could've taken a turn for Drake in 2018. As the new year dawned, the Canadian
                superstar had been on top of the rap game for nearly a decade, and each of his last seven projects—four
                albums and three mixtapes—had reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200. That kind of longevity is rare in pop
                music and virtually unheard of in hip-hop, so on some level, Drizzy was due for a drop-off. And then
                there
                was the massive L he took in May of 2018, when longtime rival Pusha T decisively won their beef by
                revealing
                to the world in “The Story of Adidon” that Drake was “hiding a child” he'd fathered out of wedlock.
            </p>
            <p>
                But neither the march of time nor Pusha's bombshell did much to slow Drake's momentum. The cocksure
                Canadian
                had himself another very successful 2018, and looking over his list of accomplishments, it's no surprise
                that he stands as the top hip-hop artist of that year on Genius according to pageviews.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drake's first major move in 2018 was releasing the two-song Scary Hours EP, featuring the bouncy single
                “Go's Plan,” in which Drizzy makes his fame and fortune sound like an act of divine will. It's not
                exactly
                a song of gratitude, though he does shoutout “the broskies”—producer Noah “40” Shebib and manager Oliver
                El-Khatib—for helping him build a career he couldn't have made on his own. In perhaps the most quoted
                line
                of the song, Drake once again embodies the cuddly playboy persona that's long been his shtick. He makes
                no
                apology for being emotionally unavailable to the women he beds, yet he expects we'll still find him
                sweet
                and lovable because he's such a mama's boy.
            </p>

            <h5>She say, “Do you love me?” I tell her, “Only partly
                I only love my bed and my mama, I'm sorry”
            </h5>



            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpVfcZ0ZcFM?si=8hd6yTp1FNuhCjhf&autoplay=0"></iframe>

            <p>“God's Plan” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Drake his first solo chart-topper,
                and
                it broke a record for on-demand first-week streams. The in early February, Drake guested on Memphis
                rapper
                BlocBoy JB's “Look Alive,” and a month later, he turned up on Migos' “Walk It Talk It.” The latter
                became
                Drake's 70th Top 40 hit on the Hot 100, and when both songs reached their impressive chart peaks, Drake
                surpassed JAY-Z to become the rapper with the most all-time Top 10 hits (23) on the Hot 100.
            </p>
            <p>
                The good times continued into April, as a new Drake single, “Nice for What,” debuted atop the Hot 100,
                replacing “God's Plan,” which had commanded the summit for 11 weeks. Then came May and the release of
                Pusha
                T's DAYTONA, a Kanye West-produced album that concludes with “Infrared,” a song loaded with some
                subliminal
                Drake disses that weren't lost on the public. The chief criticism leveled in Pusha's song is that Drake
                uses
                ghostwriters, and Drizzy responded hours later with “Duppy Freestyle,” in which he deflects the
                accusation
                as only he can.
            </p>

            <h5>Whoever supposedly makin' me hits
                But then got no hits sound like they need me
                My hooks did it, my lyrics did it
                My spirit did it, I'm fearless with it, yeah</h5>

            <p>Pusha responded with the nuclear option. On “The Story of Adidon,” which flips the beat from
                JAY-Z's
                “The Story of O.J.,” Pusha reveals that Drake has a son, Adonis, and that he'd been planning on
                introducing
                the youngster to the world via an Adidas campaign. To make matters worse, the cover art is an image of
                Drake
                in blackface taken by photographer David Leyes years earlier. It was “one of the most vicious, merciless
                takedowns in rap history,” according to Stereogum critic Tom Breihan, and everyone wondered how in the
                hell
                Drake was going to strike back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Except he didn't really need to. In June, Drake dropped his eagerly anticipated fifth album, Scorpion, a
                ridiculously long and lush-sounding double LP that addresses, among other things, his anxieties about
                being
                a single father and his reasons for keeping Adonis a secret. On the song “Emotionless,” featuring a
                sample
                of the club remix of Mariah Carey's 1991 classic “Emotions,” Drake completely flips Pusha's “deadbeat
                dad”
                narrative and paints himself as a caring father acting purely out of concern for his boy's wellbeing.
            </p>

            <h5>I wasn't hiding my kid from the world
                I was hiding the world from my kid
                From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
                Until you staring at your seed, you can never relate</h5>

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qIXhOXfx-qY?si=CDb8O2zF6GbdjZr_"></iframe>

            <p>Scorpion concludes with “March 14,” named for the day in which Drake learned via DNA test that
                French
                artist and former adult film star Sophia Brussaux was pregnant with his child. In the song, Drake is
                frank
                about how awful he feels about the whole situation. As the product of a broken home, he always thought
                he'd
                do better with his own kids.

            </p>

            <h5>It's breaking my spirit
                Single father, I hate when I hear it
                I used to challenge my parents on every album
                Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent</h5>

            <p>In addition to being a PR win, Scorpion was a super-mega blockbuster. It set single-day streaming
                records on Spotify and Apple Music, and all 25 tracks made the Billboard Hot 100. And because “Look
                Alive”
                and Lil Baby's Drake-assisted “Yes Indeed” were still on the charts, Drake found himself with 27 songs
                on
                the Hot 100, a new record. Seven of those tunes made the Top 10, giving Drake 31 over the course of his
                career and making him the male solo artist with the most Top 10 pop hits. (The artist he surpassed?
                Michael
                Jackson, who appears posthumously on the Scorpion track “Don't Matter to Me.”)
            </p>

            <p>
                Among those Top 10 hits was another No. 1, “In My Feelings,” which spawned a viral (and potentially
                dangerous) dance challenge and kept Drake in the headlines throughout July 2018. The following month,
                Drake
                turned up uncredited on Travis Scott's “Sicko Mode,” which topped the Hot 100 and became one of the
                year's
                biggest rap hits. Drake is feeling celebratory on the chorus, his umpteenth opportunity to brag about
                the
                staggering distance between where he came from (public transportation) and where he now resides (public
                jets).
            </p>

            <h5>She's in love with who I am
                Back in high school, I used to bus it to the dance (Yeah)
                Now I hit the FBO with duffels in my hands</h5>

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ONRf7h3Mdk?si=BPeGro6GNPZbmwRh"></iframe>

            <p>And Drake still wasn't done. In August, he teamed with hip-hop's then-hottest group for the
                four-month
                Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour, and in October, he showed off his Spanish skills on Bad Bunny's “MIA,”
                which
                gave Drake one last Top 5 hit to end the year. In November, Drake announced plans to take time off and
                focus
                on producing movies and TV shows, and sure enough, in 2019, he became executive producer of HBO's
                Euphoria
                and Netflix's Top Boy.</p>

            <p>Drake may not appear again in this column as the top hip-hop artist of any other year on Genius.
                But
                between 2011 and 2018, he earned the honor four times: 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018. While he and Kendrick
                Lamar might legitimately argue about which artist dominated hip-hop in the 2010s, The Guardian had it
                spot
                on when it declared Drake the “definitive pop star of his generation.”</p>
